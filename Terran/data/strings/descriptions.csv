terran_wraith,SHIP,"The Wraith is the space superiority fighter of the Terran,  carrying two missile racks and one point for a main gun, typically used on ground targets.  Known as the ""phantom killers,"" they contain a cloaking field and high speed to flank and blast any unsuspecting target with a barrage of missiles, however their ability to forge missiles on-board allow for weaker missiles for either a more supportive role or a better central gun. However, it is extremely fragile - requiring the best of the best pilots in order to make use of its power - and in the right hands, it could possibly take down those ten times its weight.",,,
terran_hercules,SHIP,"A large, chunky thing, the Hercules Is a commercial cargo transport with application as an extremely effective dropship - capable of carrying huge vehicles for ground support and large amounts of crew or troops, along with fast deployment. While it does have shields, it tends to rely on its thick armor and hull to keep it safe if it somehow would find itself in a firefight.",,,
terran_viking,SHIP,"Not created for space combat, the Viking has no defensive systems besides its own armor and speed, leaving it very vulnerable to anything it can't outrun or dodge. However, it is an extremely capable strike craft, carrying two above-average missile hardpoints for a frigate. This lets it run in and deploy a large or deadly volley of missiles at its target before retreating, usually at a safe distance from weapons that would normally take it down.",,,
